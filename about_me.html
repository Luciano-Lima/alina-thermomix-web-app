              Hi, I'm Alina Cristescu, a Master Colourist with over 20 years of experience in hairdressing. Working
              with people and making them feel beautiful has always been my passion. I love seeing the joy a fresh
              hairstyle brings to someone’s day!
            </p>
            <p>
              A few years ago, I discovered the Thermomix® TM6. With my busy schedule, I needed fast, simple, and healthy
              meal solutions—cooking was a necessity, not a hobby. But Thermomix changed that! Though I’ve never been
              someone who loved cooking, I found myself recommending it to others because it genuinely makes life
              easier.
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe in
              this product, not just because it simplifies cooking, but because it builds a community. I offer free
              demonstrations—either in person or via video call—so you can see firsthand how it works and how it could
              fit into your life.
            </p>

                  For me, the journey began when I bought my own Thermomix® TM6 from a friend. Its intuitive design and the
                  Cookidoo app opened up a world of possibilities, new recipes, better meal planning, and even grocery
                  shopping all in one place! Plus, its guided cooking feature ensures a perfect result every time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What really sold me was how much time and money I saved. The Thermomix® TM6 streamlined my kitchen,
                  replacing over 20 gadgets and freeing up space while offering endless options for meals. My daughter was
                  amazed by the self-clean mode and the ease of use, and it completely changed how we approach food at
                  home.
                </p>
                <em>
                  I always say: we upgrade our phones regularly, but nothing compares to the value you get from a
                  Thermomix. It’s an investment that pays for itself in time, convenience, and the joy of cooking.
                  
                </em><br>
                <p>
                  If you’re curious, let’s schedule a demo. I’ll show you how this incredible gadget can transform your
                  kitchen and make life easier. Whether you're passionate about cooking or, like me, just need to get food
                  on the table, Thermomix has something for everyone.
                </p>
